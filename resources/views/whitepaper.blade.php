                            will be released at the IVO and will be sold at the start rate of N25 to end at N50 per one.
                            One Hundred  Million (100,000,000) Vouchers will be sold to people who missed the IVO at the current
                            value of the voucher after two months, and the remaining one hundred  million (100,000,000) vouchers

                            during the IVO stages and increases
                            in value at 50% every month during the two months' frozen stage, and increases between at 5%

                        <h3>Expected Registered Users</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The minimum expected number of registered users all over West Africa is 250,000 and

                            It is a voucher of its own kind; the voucher is an investment that when you buy it, it
                            increases in value between
                            5% to 10% every month based on the mathematical algorithm it has been programmed with.

                            VilCaz Voucher is like any gift vouchers or gift cards that can be used to shop instead
                            of fiat currency but it is a virtual voucher which means it can only be digitally used as it
                            is not a physical voucher.
                            It is designed with some of the features of crypto currency and existing vouchers but does
                            not specifically lean toward
                            either as it is a voucher of its own kind.

                        <p>
                            By July 1st, 2018, a voucher would have worth the rate of N112.5 with the ability to
                            increase between 5% to 10% every month which will come to a total of N266.5 at the end of the 12th month. Imagine a voucher that you bought
                            at N25 in December 2017 and you are able to use
                            to purchase goods and services at the value rate of &#x20a6;173 at the end of December
                            2018. And
                            the value still continue appreciating forever!
                            The value will be greatly influenced by the users' constantly exchanging it for goods and
                            services.

                            Frozen Stage
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The vouchers will be frozen for two months after the last token sale. Each voucher will increase rapidly in value at 50% per one month.
                            This frozen stage is a stage where the users cannot make use of the voucher for any exchange till the two months has passed.
                            Any newly opened wallet at any point in time will always experience a frozen stage of two months before the vouchers in it
                            can be used in exchange for goods and services. But it will only increase in value at the rate other non-frozen vouchers are increasing.
                            The advantage for buying during the token sale is that the vouchers will increase at 50% twice while frozen. It will always be frozen for a month
                            at the end of every exchange year.
